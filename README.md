Relation Networks are a neural network module which are specialized to learn relations, just as convolutional kernels are specialized to process images. RNs are useful for Visual Question Answering, where they hold state-of-the-art results.

My Keras implementation uses the Functional API to define the network.  One generalization to RNs is the use of a selection kernel which picks k distinct random objects from the processed image tensor instead of all n^2 objects.  This allows for a much smaller number of relation vectors when k << n^2.

Above is an example image which could have the following question: "Q: Are there an equal number of large things and metal spheres?"

## Architecture
Images are processed using a CNN, while the questions are processed using an LSTM.  These tensors are then decomposed into objects and fed as input into the RN module.

## Experiments
### 60000 Questions / 6000 Images
Training a RN using 10% of the train data results in ~80% accuracy after 100 epochs, which shows that using a random entity selection kernel still results in compelling results after a short training period.
